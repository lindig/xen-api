(*
 * This module implements a cache with support for a least-recently-used
 * (LRU) replacement policy. Main features:
 *
 * Implemented with standard OCaml data types, no dependency on outside
 * libararies for the main functionality.
 *
 * Implemented with mutable state. This keeps the implementation compact
 * and efficient but requires thinking about state more.
 *
 * The architecture is: elements are kept in a hash table to look them
 * up based on a key. Additionally they are kept in a doubly linked
 * list. The head of the list is the least recently used element that
 * can be dropped to make room in the cache. When an element is found in
 * the cache it is moved to the tail of the linked list.

  (** [drop] a node [n] from (its) list [t]. The interesting property is
      that we can drop any element from its list that we know. However,
      we don't check that [n] is indeed a member of [t] and it's an
      unchecked error to pass an [n] that is not a member of [t].

      This is similar to a
      pointer-based implementation in C. We infer that we need to update
      the fist, last entry of the list of [n]'s prev or next is [None],
      hence it is the first or last element in the list. *)
